# chatcli
A Project to help with cli commands.

# Ideas
- Allow conversation
- More flags for customization
- Allow config file to customize pre and post prompt [x]

# Install
I will potentially make this installable via a package manager at some point, but since its very WIP,
this is the easiest.

```
$ pip install -r requirements
$ ./install.sh
```

# Uninstall
```
$ ./uninstall.sh
```
